## Building
- Use Visual Studio 2022
- Grab the `External` folder from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RizdKDwa0dFaKtjGTvYgzTrDVI_mhIT/view?usp=drive_link).

The codebase is largely based on boilerplate from [Norbyte's DOS2 Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/ositools), hence the awkward `External` folder.

UIs were modified using JPEXS v20.1.0; the modified ActionScript files (with added comments) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kqdQQltpmnTpyOu90PqFY7cVkElm4Z1s/view?usp=drive_link).
